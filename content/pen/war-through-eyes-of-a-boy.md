### Zehra Nigah's "Gul Baadshaah"
---------------------------

Zehra Nigah is a well known poet. This is a "nazm"(a free flowing form of poetry in Urdu) which was written by her which narrates situation from the perspective of a boy caught in midst of a war. This was written in context of Afghanistan's war and conflict in the zone during the troubled times of civil war. "Gul Baadshaah" is that boy from the countryside who sees everything burning around him and near and dear ones getting killed.

Through her unique sensibility the poetess very aptly describes the nature and futility of martyr-dom, and the in the final stranza in a "tanz"(sarcastic way) tells how 'huminity' means in context of war - from the perspective of Gul Baadshaah.
