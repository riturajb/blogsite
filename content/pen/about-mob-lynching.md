### A Note on Communalism These Days and The Art
------------------------------------------------

<br>کیا تھا مشٹیل جو اسے گھر کا ہر رنگ بدلنے مے<br>
ایک میرا کہوں ہی کام آیا  جھلک گروہ  بنانے مے

We live in different times now. So many communual riots and unrest. Yes, this is a blog related to music and poetry - but then this is a random mushing about current state of affairs and hence the above tweet. I feel things are bit too bitter at the moment with all the mob lynchings going on in the country in the name of religion.<br><br>
I hope and think this sort of bitterness would not seep into the matters of art and poetry. No, not so soon. One has to have certain amount of broadmindedness when it comes to art. For example think of a Bismillah Khan - without whom auspicious moments of Hindu marriages would be incomplete. We are thankfully yet to see a fanatical voice who objects to such a thing - and if it does that will be a very very sad day<br>
Similarly if and when someone would object to speakers of Urdu of not being Indian enough - that also would be sad day. Hope we dont see such days.<br><br>
Below song is about hope - that things would get better ...
